Reads the Million Song Dataset (or MillionSongSubset) into records containing ID, artist, album, song and pitches (chroma) 

To run this test, you will have to download the Echonest Million Song Subset, available at:
    http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/pages/getting-dataset#subset
which links directly to the file:
    http://static.echonest.com/millionsongsubset_full.tar.gz
Extract the tarball to a directory and set the root_path variable in the code
to the data root directory.

Has been tested in Windows 7.

Dependencies:
  Python 2.7
  h5py library

How to use:
  From your Python application, import the load_million_song.py module. Iterate over the song data by calling 
  iterate_folder_songs_extracted(root_path, filename_re),
  where root_path is the path to the data folder in the Million Song Dataset (or subset), and filename_re is 
  a regular expression to identify a valid H5 datset, e.g., "^[A-Z]{7}[0-9,A-F]{11}\.h5$"
  An example of a song data file name is TRBIJIA128F425F57D.h5
